# About Me
##### Who am I?
##### Why Biosystems?
##### Career Goals
I am interested in opting in to Auburn's advanced master's program for Biosystems Engineering, so that when I graduate in Spring of 2022, I will get to graduate with both a BS and MS from Auburn. I have done undergraduate research for Auburn since my freshman year of college, and discovered that research is a passion of mine. I enjoy constantly learning and testing theories and trying to discover the most efficient way to do things. Beyond Auburn, my dream is to go to grad school for my PhD, preferably at the University of Michigan, my dream graduate school. After that, my career goals are to hopefully work for the government doing research related to sustainability and how to help our country evolve from our current infrastructure, packaging materials, and fuels, to infrastructure, packing materials, and fuels that are beneficial to our environment and prolonged existence.
