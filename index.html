        <h3 class="top-header">About Me</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida, and spent the majority of my childhood outdoors catching various animals, insects, and getting heavily invested in plant-life. As a child I was an avid reader, enjoyed math, and I shared a wide variety of pets with my older sister. I was especially close with my paternal grandparents, my Abuelos, who helped teach me Spanish alongside my father and other family members. My Abuelo is a plant pathologist and entomologist, and has many passion progrects involving hydroponic and aquaponic systems, which caught my interest at a very young age. He taught at and did research for Auburn University for many years as well, which is the main source of my inspiration to do research and hopefully become a professor myself one day. My parents encouraged my fondness for math and science throughout my schooling, and as a high school senior I had decided on engineering, but I wasn’t sure which branch to major in. At Auburn I started out in Chemical engineering, hoping to specialize in environmental engineering, however the courses I was required to take didn’t show the possible applications for someone with an environmental application, and instead were heavily focused on industrial applications, which did not interest me. Better late than never, I made the switch into Biosystems Engineering and have found the major better suited to my career aspirations and personal passions. As of the spring of 2022, I have received my BS in Biosystems Engineering, and hope to work toward my Master's at Auburn University as well. As for personal interests, I have far too many plants and experiment with hydroponic and semi-hydroponic set ups for them. I consider myself an amateur orchidist, and have other hobbies such as running, sewing, and cooking. My husband, <a href="https://andrewjmcgehee.github.io">Andrew</a>, and I have two cats, Munchie and Stinky, that provide endless moral support and snuggles during my studies.</p>

        <h3 class="top-header">Why Biosystems Engineering</h3>
        <p>I chose <a href="http://bulletin.auburn.edu/undergraduate/samuelginncollegeofengineering/departmentofbiosystemsengineering/#text">Biosystems Engineering</a> because of my passion for the environment and my desire to make a positive impact on the world we live in. I enjoy all the possibilities where I can possibly work with a Biosystems degree to solve world problems, and I appreciate that the major as a whole has a very positive and progressive outlook for the future. Biosystems is such a versatile major, and I love that I could work in any setting involving biological applications, environmental applications, systems engineering, or civil engineering. The stability of knowing I will have many options and opportunities for jobs is a great comfort. Even more comforting is the fact that all the applications of my major are jobs I would be happy to work. I appreciate how Biosystems allows me to keep an open mind for my future and any career changes I may decide to make. Talking to students and professors in my major, they talk about their passion for biofuels or plant-based plastics, and their desire to improve our world and keep moving forward. That’s the kind of major I prefer, one that provides a learning environment where what is stressed the most isn’t the starting pay you’ll get when you graduate, but the impact you will make and how you can improve the world for yourself, your family, and everyone around you.</p>

        <h3 class="top-header">Career Goals</h3>
        <p>As of the spring of 2022, I have obtained my Bachelor's of Science in Biosystems Engineering from Auburn University. While working towards my BS, I was in Auburn’s Accelerated Bachelor's/Master’s (ABM) program for Biosystems Engineering, so during my undergraduate career I took some courses at the graduate level for credit and have some research already under my belt. I did undergraduate research for Auburn since my freshman year of college, and discovered that research is a passion of mine. I enjoy constantly learning and testing theories and trying to discover the most efficient way to do things. After getting my Master's, my dream is to go to grad school for my PhD, preferably at the University of Texas at Austin or University of Michigan, my top two choices for graduate schools. After that, my career goals are to get a research-related job at either a government facility or a university where I can continue to research topics I am passionate about, such as phytoremediation, hydroponics, aquaponics, storm water runoff control, algal growth, and combating food and clean water shortages. I have always believed that the best way to give back to your community is to do so in the form of sharing and spreading knowledge, so at some point later in my career, I have plans to return to academia and teach at a university to help future students like myself.</p>
